## Accuracy issues

Accuracy of modern systems is still unstable, that means sometimes you can have a very good accuracy and sometimes it could be bad.
It is hard to make a system that will work good. And there could be many reasons for that:

  * Audio has very bad quality
  * Vocabulary of the system doesn't match (yes, we still use fixed vocabulary)
  * Audio conditions like accent were not really the ones that were used in training
  * Some unpredictable audio issues like frame drop or frame coding bugs
  * Software bugs

It is hard to guess what is going on under the hood without getting your hands dirty. For that reason in case of any accuracy
issues you must provide the following for analysis:

  * Who are you, where are you from and why are you doing that. We don't like dealing with anonymous
  * The complete and exact description of the system you want to build - what is it going to do, what do you want to build
  * The precise description of hardware you are trying to run the system on
  * The detailed list of software versions you are using
  * Audio samples to demonstrate the problem together with the reference transcription for those samples

Remember, the more information you provide the faster you get a solution.
